h1. tellmewhen

Tell me when another program has finshed.  Show me when it started, when it finished and how long it took.  Show me the output and if it errored.

I created this utility because I had long running database scripts that I wanted a completion notification for - including a summary of the time and exit code.  I had done this various ways in the past by using bash and other shell utilities.  This program captures all of the features and behavior I wanted without having to script it from scratch again every time I needed it.

* YML Based Configuration in an rc file
* easy default configuration
* sends email
* includes start/stop/elapsed timing
* success/fail based on exit code
* watch an already running process (by pid, by grep pattern over 'ps aux')
* release as a gem so it's easy to use/install

h1. Configuration

Configuration Defaults:

Configuration is then merged from @$HOME/.tellmewhenrc@ if the file exists in @$HOME@.  Configuration is also merged from @./.tellmewhenrc@ in the current directory, if the file exists.  This allows you some flexibility in overriding settings.

h1. Examples

  ./tellmewhen 'sleep 3; ls'
  ./tellmewhen -p 12345
